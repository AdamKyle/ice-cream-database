 *     'port' => 3306,

 *     'password' => 'root',

 *   ],
 *   'sqlite' => [ 'templ_file' => ':memory' ]
 * ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is then passed into constructor and the associated connections are created.
 *
 * You then have access to db() method where you can pass in a connection name of mysql or psql
 * to get the associated connection or pass in nothing and get the default connection.
 *
 * This is a thin wrapper around PDO so you have access to all the PDO methods and are responsible
 * for handling how you disconnect, which you can do by: $conn->manager->closeAllConnections() to close
 * all database connections.
