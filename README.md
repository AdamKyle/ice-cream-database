# Ice Cream Active Record

An Active Record Implementation for the Ice Cream components that can together create a small versatile
web framework.

- Requires PHP 7
- Is Standalone

## Install

`composer require ice-cream/database`

## Purpose?

I wanted to understand PDO, and I still have a lot to learn about it. I could have used and created a thin wrapper around Doctrines DBAL, much like I did with [Ice Cream Router](https://github.com/AdamKyle/ice-cream-router) in the sense that I did a thin wrapper around Symfony's router.

But I thought I could build something super simple, super easy to get started with and something that
allowed me to understand exactly how PHP connects to a database.

While this isn't as fully flushed out as a regular DBAL, it is a good step in the process. You open a connection, get a db object back, do your work and then manually close the connection.

There is room for growth here and room for improvement and your feedback and help will help to shape Ice Cream components into a framework.

## Configuration

Create a new connection instance:

```PHP
use IceCreamDatabase\Connect;

// Similar to that of Laravel if you are familiar.
$connections = [
  'mysql' => [
    'host' => 127.0.0.1,
    'port' => 3306,
    'database' => 'nameOfDatabase',
    'username' => 'WhoAreYou',
    'password' => 'password',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
  ],
  'pgsql' => [
    'host' => 127.0.0.1,
    'port' => 3306,
    'database' => 'nameOfDatabase',
    'username' => 'WhoAreYou',
    'password' => 'password',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
  ],
]

// At this time I have made the choice to only support mysql and pgsql connections.
// More can be added in the future, simplicity was the game here.

$con = new Connect($connections);
```

This will throw a PDO exception if we cannot connect to the database. This constructor will also connect to all databases registered in the connection array.

So now that we are connected what can we do?

```php
$con->db()->exec( ... );

// Should you have multiple databases configured you can do:

$con->db('mysql')->exec( ... );
$con->db('pgsql')->exec( ... );
```

Once you are done with your database transactions you will have to manually close the connection your self:

```php
$con->manager()->closeConnection('mysql'); // or `pgsql`

// Or to close all connections:
$con->manager->closeAllConnections();

// Both functions will either return true or false if the connections container is empty or the connection
// cannot be found.
```
